The previous engineer's work centered on a series of complex, interconnected bug fixes stemming from user reports. The initial request to investigate a data loading performance issue was quickly superseded by a critical bug preventing admins from viewing proof images in the Super Admin Approval section. The engineer traced this to multiple root causes: an incorrect file path (duplicate ), missing data preservation in the backend logic, and a lack of frontend validation for empty paths.

As these were fixed, a cascade of related bugs in the Transfer Wallet proof edit workflow was uncovered. These included: a failure to submit proof edits due to a backend type error ( was required for a GCS upload), proof edits not appearing in the Super Admin queue, incorrect account names displaying for review, and approved edits not updating the original transfer record.

Finally, the engineer addressed several UI/UX inconsistencies on the Transfer Wallet page, adding a missing Proof in Review badge and fixing its missing animation, which was ultimately caused by an insufficiently wide table column. The entire process involved iterative debugging across the full stack, modifying React components (, ) and multiple FastAPI endpoints in  to ensure data consistency and correct UI representation.

The Rimuru application is a multi-faceted platform for merchants and administrators, facilitating financial transactions, ad account management, and order processing. The primary goal of the recent work was to resolve a series of critical bugs and inconsistencies in the Proof Edit workflow, ensuring functional parity between the Top Up Akun and Transfer Wallet features.

Key requirements addressed:
1.  **Super Admin Proof Viewing:** Admins must be able to reliably view Current and New proof images submitted for review without encountering Failed to load proof errors.
2.  **Proof Edit Submission:** Users must be able to submit edited proof files on the Transfer Wallet page without backend errors.
3.  **Consistent Workflow:** When a proof is edited for a Wallet Transfer, it must trigger the same workflow as a Top Up:
    *   A Proof In Review badge must appear on the item.
    *   The request must appear in the Super Admin's Pending Proof Edits queue with the correct account name.
    *   Upon Super Admin approval, the new proof image must replace the old one in the Transfer Wallet record.
4.  **UI/UX Parity:** UI elements, such as animated status badges, should be consistent across different management pages.

<key_technical_concepts>
- **React.js**: Frontend development, state management (useState, useEffect), and conditional rendering.
- **FastAPI**: Python backend framework for building API endpoints.
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database used for storing all application data.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for styling and layout, including responsive design and animations ().
- **Google Cloud Storage (GCS)**: Used for file storage; debugging involved correcting file upload logic.
- **Python **: Used to wrap binary data (bytes) into a file-like object for library compatibility (GCS upload).

<code_architecture>
The application follows a standard full-stack architecture with a React frontend, a FastAPI backend, and a MongoDB database. Supervisor is used for process management.

**Directory Structure:**


- ****
  - **Importance**: This is the main backend file containing all API logic. It was the central point for most of the bug fixes.
  - **Summary of Changes**:
    - **Proof Edit Submission ():** Fixed a  during GCS upload by wrapping the file content in  before passing it to the upload function.
    - **Pending Edits Queue ():** Heavily modified to include  in addition to . Corrected logic to fetch the right  and fixed a double  prefix bug that caused broken image links.
    - **Proof Edit Approval/Rejection ( & ):** Added logic to handle . Upon approval, the new proof URL is now correctly updated in the  collection. Upon rejection, the  flag is cleared.

- ****
  - **Importance**: The UI for Super Admins to review and approve pending actions, including proof edits.
  - **Summary of Changes**:
    - Added validation to the  function to prevent API calls with empty paths.
    - Implemented conditional rendering to disable the View Proof button if no proof path exists, preventing user confusion and errors.
    - A timestamp comment was added to attempt to force a browser cache refresh to resolve a suspected  error.

- ****
  - **Importance**: The UI for managing wallet transfer requests, where several UI/UX bugs were reported.
  - **Summary of Changes**:
    - Added the Proof In Review badge with a spinning icon to the Actions column for items with a pending edit, ensuring UI consistency with other pages.
    - Replaced the  icon with an inline SVG for the spinner to debug a rendering issue.
    - **Final Fix**: Increased the width of the AKSI (Actions) table header column from  to , as the narrow width was preventing the spinner icon from rendering.

</code_architecture>

<pending_tasks>
- The initial user-reported issue, ga bisa memuat data (data fails to load) on the admin clients page, was deprioritized but never resolved.
- The  component was noted to be missing a mobile-responsive card view, which is inconsistent with other admin pages.
- Complete testing of all the recent fixes across different user roles and scenarios.
- The list of pending tasks from the initial prompt remains, including Facebook Ads API integration, timezone issues, and others.

<current_work>
The engineer was resolving a user-reported UI bug on the **Transfer Wallet Management** page (). The user noted that the Proof In Review badge, which was recently added, did not have the spinning animation that was present on other pages.

After several attempts to fix the issue—including verifying icon imports, replacing the icon library component with an inline SVG, and restarting the frontend—the user suggested that the table column might be too narrow. The engineer confirmed this was the root cause. The AKSI (Actions) column had a fixed width of , which was insufficient to display both the icon and the text, causing the icon to be hidden.

The final action taken was to edit , increasing the column width to  to provide enough space for the badge to render correctly. The frontend service was then restarted to apply this change. The system is now awaiting user confirmation that the spinning icon is visible.

<optional_next_step>
Confirm with the user that the spinning animation on the Proof In Review badge in the Transfer Wallet Management page is now visible and working correctly after widening the Aksi column.
